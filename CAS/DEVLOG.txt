[2011.12.23] Just did some 7.2 vs 7.4 tests
===========================================

The test suite runs very slowly on a multicore system with load.  I
just ran on an older 16 core system and it took:

    7.2.1    -N16 : 3.5 minutes
    7.3....  -N16 : 1.25 minutes

Versus on my macbook air laptop with four threads (including
hyperthreading):

    7.2.1    -N4 : 14.3 seconds
    7.4.0RC1 -N4 : 2.8s
