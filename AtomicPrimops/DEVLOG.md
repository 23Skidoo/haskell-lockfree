Ok, here's the weird state of affairs at the moment.

 * Mac os, build test in-place compiling directly with Data.Atomics -- WORKS
 * mac os, cabal install then build test                            -- SEGFAULTS
 * linux, build test in-place compiling directly with Data.Atomics -- Fails link, no "cas".
 * linux, cabal install then build test            -- WORKS (but I thought segfaulted earlier?

Weird, right?  Well, I'm not surprised by the failed link, because
right now the foreign primops are trying to use a function defined in
SMP.h inside the GHC RTS.  That may be illegitemate.  (But at the same
time it is EXTERN_INLINE so shouldn't it just inline it before link
time?)

Note that SMP.h is included by Stg.h which is included by Rts.h.
Rts.h is included all over the place, but not directly by Cmm.h.

Anyway, putting in some extra printfs verifies that in the segfaulting
case it is returning a ticket of "zero" which implies that it's
probably returning zero for the Haskell pointer as well, which could
definitely cause a segfault downstream.  In fact, I see similar
behavior if I just hack the CMM to return an invalid pointer:

    stg_readMutVar2zh {
      RET_NP(19, 19);
    }
