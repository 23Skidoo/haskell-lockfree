[2013.04.05] {A note on the ChaseLev crashes}
=============================================

On the Mine machines this will consistently get an uninitialized
error:

   time NUMELEMS=5000000 ./dist/build/test-chaselev-deque/test-chaselev-deque -tOneBot +RTS -N4

[2013.05.16] {Was being very silly before.}

That "one bottle neck" test should NOT run on chase lev.  It has
multiple threads WRITING to the left end.
